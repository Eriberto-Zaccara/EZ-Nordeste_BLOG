# EZ-Nordeste_BLOG
Database schema, ajax requests and routes. used for blogs

MVC: Built based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which clearly separates concerns of data modeling, presentation logic, and user interaction. This makes our code highly organized, scalable, and easy to maintain.

PHP: We use PHP as the primary programming language for development. PHP is a solid choice for web development due to its simplicity and efficiency.

Database and PDO Connection: Our data is securely stored in SQL Server, a robust database management system. To access the database, we use a PDO (PHP Data Objects) interface, providing security and portability in our database operations.

Ajax Requests: We enhance the user experience by incorporating Ajax requests into our blog. This means our readers can load articles quickly and seamlessly without needing to refresh the page.

Security: Passwords in the control panel are stored with secure hashes.
